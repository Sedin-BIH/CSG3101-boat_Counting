# CSG3101-boat_Counting
The Repository involves the yolov8 algorithm developed by Ultralytics, connected to the deepsort algorithm. A python notebook containing steps for training, a GUI and the SIngapore Maritime Dataset in YOLO format.

One of the key deliverables of the Project is: A compressed file of labelled data and dataset for either the Fisheries Dataset or Singapore Maritime Dataset.
Below is a link to a Google Drive containing the Compressed file of the Singapore Maritime Dataset.

The training, validation and Testing components are split into the following:
70% for training, 20% for validation and 10% for testing. If you are looking to use your own dataset i.e the Recreational Boat Fishing Dataset it must be in YOLO format with Frames seperated and labels in a seperate .txt file as seen in the Compressed Zip File of the Singapore Maritime Dataset.
